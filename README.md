# Time-Management-API
The boilerplate of the mobile application. 

It's a joint application, we both work on the application for the end of university project. This will be my own version of the API.
The project is restarted from scratch because ideas about what the projects must be have changed. For now, the priority is adding the following functionalities:

-a login, register, a forgot password and send confirmation email
- Register
- Login
- Send Confirmation Email
- Forgot Password
- User Model
